Thanks for contacting Questrade. My name is Rochelle. How can I help you? 
customer (8/11/2021, 7:40:15 AM): Hi Rochelle, Good Morning 
Rochelle L (8/11/2021, 7:40:21 AM): Hi there! 
customer (8/11/2021, 7:40:33 AM): I've initiated a wire transfer to Questrade in USD 
customer (8/11/2021, 7:40:50 AM): It is to my margin account 28308165 
Rochelle L (8/11/2021, 7:41:01 AM): I can certainly look into this for you. 
Rochelle L (8/11/2021, 7:41:05 AM): Before I begin, I just need to ask you a few very quick verification questions. Could you begin with providing the following information for security purposes:

- What is your full-name? 		 
- What is your full birthday? 
- How many active “completed” accounts do you have with Questrade? 
- What is one stock/securities that you have in an account? 
customer (8/11/2021, 7:41:58 AM): Ajay Mani
January 20, 1981
I've one account - not sure if it is completed
No stocks as of now 
Rochelle L (8/11/2021, 7:42:04 AM): Sorry for the confusion and yes, completed accounts are how many accounts you have with us. 
Rochelle L (8/11/2021, 7:42:06 AM): Thank you for verifying, Ajay. 
Rochelle L (8/11/2021, 7:42:10 AM): To clarify,  was this a wire transfer into Questrade? 
customer (8/11/2021, 7:42:15 AM): yes 
Rochelle L (8/11/2021, 7:42:33 AM): May I ask when the wire transfer was made? 
customer (8/11/2021, 7:42:37 AM): I just initiated it yesterday 
Rochelle L (8/11/2021, 7:42:45 AM): Thank you for clarifying! 
Rochelle L (8/11/2021, 7:43:07 AM): Wire transfers take 1-2 business days for the funds to arrive and as you made the request yesterday, you can expect to see the funds by tomorrow. 
customer (8/11/2021, 7:43:15 AM): that's fine 
Rochelle L (8/11/2021, 7:43:30 AM): Once the funds arrive, you would get a notification and can then see it on my.questrade.com > Reports > Account activity. 
customer (8/11/2021, 7:43:47 AM): the wire transfer is in USD. Is there anything that I need to do so that it does not get converted to CAD? 
Rochelle L (8/11/2021, 7:44:24 AM): The funds in the margin account stay as is when deposited; meaning CAD gets deposited as CAD and USD gets deposited as USD. 
Rochelle L (8/11/2021, 7:44:38 AM): Can I assist with anything else today? 
customer (8/11/2021, 7:45:06 AM): that's all I wanted to confirm 
customer (8/11/2021, 7:45:18 AM): thank you for your time and assistance 
Rochelle L (8/11/2021, 7:45:23 AM): Happy to help, Ajay! Please don’t hesitate to contact us back if you have any inquiries. Thank you for contacting Questrade, and have a wonderful day! 
customer (8/11/2021, 7:45:36 AM): thanks, you too! 
Rochelle L (8/11/2021, 7:45:40 AM): Thank you!
