        "1. What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?\n",
        "re.compile() is used to generate Regex objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
        "Raw strings are used so that backslashes do not have to be escaped.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the return value of the search() method?\n",
        "The re.search() method returns a Match object. It has the span and value of the match.\n",
        "If match is not found then it returns None type.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?\n",
        "groups() and group() method of match object to get the matched values\n",
        "\n",
        "5. In the regex which created from the r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)', what does group zero cover? Group 2? Group 1?\n",
        "Group zero covers the entire matched string in 123-456-7890 format\n",
        "Group one covers the first parantheses, 123 out of it.\n",
        "Group two covers the second parantheses, 456-7890 out of it.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell a regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods?\n",
        "Using the escape character backslash (\\) \n",
        "\n",
        "7. The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to return one of the two options?\n",
        "If the regex expression has groups, then list of string tuples is returned. Else list of string is returned.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. In standard expressions, what does the | character mean?\n",
        "The | character is called a pipe. It is used for OR operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. In regular expressions, what does the ? character stand for?\n",
        "? is used to match optional group\n",
        "\n",
        "10.In regular expressions, what is the difference between the + and * characters?\n",
        "The + (or plus) means “match one or more.” Unlike the star, which does not require its group to appear in the matched string, the group preceding a plus must appear at least once. It is not optional.\n",
        "The * (called the star or asterisk) means “match zero or more”—the group that precedes the star can occur any number of times in the text. It can be completely absent or repeated over and over again.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the difference between {4} and {4,5} in regular expression?\n",
        "{4} means the string is searched where the group repeats four times.\n",
        "{4,5} means the string is searched where the group repeats four or five times.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What do you mean by the \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
        "\\d - Any numeric digit from 0 to 9.\n",
        "\\w - Any letter, numeric digit, or the underscore character.\n",
        "\\s - Any space, tab, or newline character. (Think of this as matching “space” characters.)\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What do means by \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
        "\\D - Any character that is not a numeric digit from 0 to 9.\n",
        "\\W - Any character that is not a letter, numeric digit, or the underscore character.\n",
        "\\S - Any character that is not a space, tab, or newline.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the difference between .* and .*?\n",
        "The dot-star uses greedy mode: It will always try to match as much text as possible. To match any and all text in a non-greedy fashion, use the dot, star, and question mark (.*?).\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is the syntax for matching both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class?\n",
        "Either [0-9a-z] or [a-z0-9]\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the procedure for making a normal expression in regax case insensitive?\n",
        "Passing re.I or re.IGNORECASE as the second argument to re.compile() will make the matching case insensitive.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as 2nd argument in re.compile()?\n",
        "The . character normally matches any character except the newline character. If re.DOTALL is passed as the second argument to re.compile(), then the dot will also match newline characters.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. If numReg = re.compile(r'\\d+'), what will numRegex.sub('X', '11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hen') return?\n",
        "X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hen\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What does passing re.VERBOSE as the 2nd argument to re.compile() allow to do?\n",
        "The re.VERBOSE argument allows you to add whitespace and comments to the string passed to re.compile().\n",
        "\n",
        "20. How would you write a regex that match a number with comma for every three digits? It must match the given following:\n",
        "'42'\n",
        "'1,234'\n",
        "'6,368,745'\n",

        "r'^\\d{1,3}(,\\d{3})*$'\n",
        "\n",
        "21. How would you write a regex that matches the full name of someone whose last name is Watanabe? You can assume that the first name that comes before it will always be one word that begins with a capital letter. The regex must match the following:\n",
        "'Haruto Watanabe'\n",
        "'Alice Watanabe'\n",
        "'RoboCop Watanabe'\n",
        "but not the following:\n",

        "\n",
        "22. How would you write a regex that matches a sentence where the first word is either Alice, Bob, or Carol; the second word is either eats, pets, or throws; the third word is apples, cats, or baseballs; and the sentence ends with a period? This regex should be case-insensitive. It must match the following:\n",
        "'Alice eats apples.'\n",
