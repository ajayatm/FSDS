    "d = '''Will P. Brady (1876–1943) was an American lawyer, the first district attorney for Texas's 70th judicial district from 1909 to around 1914, and the judge for the El Paso County Court at Law from 1917 to 1919. Brady was born to a pioneering Austin family and grew up there. After service as a teacher in Travis County, Texas, he served as county school superintendent from 1900 to 1904. He then became a lawyer, and spent several years in private practice. As district attorney, Brady prosecuted several high-profile murder cases, including one that has since been termed a \"legal lynching\", a death penalty case of a Mexican boy charged with killing a white woman. Brady moved to El Paso in 1915 and resumed private practice, but was soon named a judge. He resigned in 1919 and moved to California to pursue interests in oil. Brady was a Democrat and deeply involved in public affairs throughout his adult life. He also incorporated both the Cruces Oil Corporation and the Pecos Valley Southern Railway.'''"
